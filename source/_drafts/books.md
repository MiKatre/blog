Some short reviews (only books that were good).

<!-- In other words, if the book didn't let a strong impression on me, I do not bother. -->

#### Fooled by Randomness

There are some books that change your perception of the world. This is one of them. A true masterpiece. The downside is that you will have a hard time talking with people about certain subjects after reading this. You have been warned.

#### The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity

Book by Carlo M. Cipolla who was an Italian social scientist. He didn't intend to publish this book, this wasn't even supposed to be a book, he wrote it to warn his family and friends about his discoveries when studying human stupidity. This book is a must. It's been a year since I read it and his definition of stupidity stuck with me. And it unfortunately explains wonderfully why some people behave the way they do.

#### Dominion

I almost closed this book due to boredom at the begining. I'm glad I finally didn't because it's an amazing book. And fun too !

#### Le Comte de Monte-Cristo

This is the sortest book I ever read, impossible to put it down, yet it is 1600 pages. I am forever grateful to Alexandre Dumas for this masterpiece, it is the book that reconciliated me French with litterature after being scarred by the procrustean school system. Some people never recover, I guess it is all about luck.

#### The Bed of Procrustes

This is the aphorisms book that is part of the incerto. I don't know if I "finished" this one because I do as the author suggested, read maximum five aphorisms per day, randomly selected.

#### A Man For All Markets

I left this book convinced that Edward O. Thorp is a genius. I came back multiple times to this book in the last few months. That is how you know that a book is good, revelation of preferences. Besides, I owe this book some very good ideas that fueled my projects. The author is currently 84 I think and his clarity of mind and physical shape are impressive. He apply his ideas about _finding an edge_ to his life. He explain in the book how he stack the odds in his favour (ergodicity). But don't even try to explain that, most people have a very hard time dealing with the concept of probability.

#### The Art Of Love

I initially bought this one among others to learn Latin. Turns out Ovid knows more about seduction than any modern author. I suspect most of what is written today about the subject is pure garbage. His suggestions, from memory, are to trust a professional with you hair an beard, have well adjusted clothes, cleanliness have short nails. And go where women abund. Advice still holds, while modern advice from the fields of sociology/psychology is already outdated. He also thinks lies are fair play when it comes to women. They are a tool of seduction. That would be morally questionable today, and even then, since he was ostracized. But there is still a clich√© about beautiful women thinking that all men are liars. Maybe all men that succesfully seduced you were liars. That goes to Ovid's point.
